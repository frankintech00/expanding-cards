# Expanding Cards

This was a learning excercise based on Udemy lesson "50 projects in 50 days" by Brad Travesty

https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50

It displays 5 cards. When clicked a card becomes active, expands and displays a title.

I commented on some aspects of the files to aid understanding and changed the class names to break the JS file and then fixed it.

I changed the images, font and h3
